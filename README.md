# dwm-theme-switcher


With this script you are able to change the theme
of dwm, neovim, dmenu, dunst and termite while running them.

The script is easy to extend for further programs
and multiple themes.

![demo](./demo.gif)


### Requirements

In order to use the script as it is you need the following
requirements installed on your machine

- dwm with reload patch
- feh
- neovim
- bash
- python3
- xdotool
- dmenu2*(Please notice that I used my dmenu2-fork, 
so this configuration won't work with the normal dmenu2)*
- termite
- dunst

### Installation

Clone this repo to `~/.themes` or to the direction you want it.


### Configuration

Edit the configuration-variables on the top of the `theme.sh`
that they match to your configuration.


### Usage

Go to the directory where you cloned this repository and execute

```
./theme.sh [theme]
```

`[theme]` need to match the name of a themes directory.


### Add new themes

Just add a new folder near to the both default themes and
edit or add the config files in the theme to your beliefs.
Take a care, that the names still match after your edit
the files!

```
Application - Name in theme dir - Default name
=========================================================
dmenu       - dmenu             - {no default}
dunst       - dunstrc           - ~/.config/dunstrc
dwm         - dwm               - $PATH/config.h
neovim      - vimrc             - ~/.vimrc
